## Architecture

TODO: descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup

- `npm install` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start the development server with Vite.
- `npm run build` to build the project for production.
- `npm run preview` to preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` to run ESLint and check for linting issues.
- `npm run lint:fix` to run ESLint and automatically fix linting issues.
- `npx depcheck` to review unused dependencies.

### Development

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application in the browser.

### Building

To build the project for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of your project.

### Previewing

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build locally, allowing you to verify it before deploying.

### Linting

To check for linting issues:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This will run ESLint on your codebase and report any linting issues.

To automatically fix linting issues:

```sh
npm run lint:fix
```

This will run ESLint with the `--fix` option, automatically fixing any fixable issues.

### Checking for Unused Dependencies

To review unused dependencies:

```sh
npx depcheck
```

This will analyze your project and report any dependencies that are not being used.
